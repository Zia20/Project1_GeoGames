# Project1_GeoGames

Project 1: Geography Game - I created this game for my nieces who love geography.

Three sets of games: 1- Name Countries
                     2- Name Oceans
                     3- Name Seas

Problems: 
    1- Ran into a lot of problems while using the async and wait method. Couldn't figure out how to use the async & wait in time to create this project. 
    2- Difficult to change 'age' input to integer
    3- Difficulty with get vs post method


Solution: Start early, next time I won't wait to start the project. Dive in and see what happens.
